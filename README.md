# MovieReviews-Frontend
A React and MantineUI frontend for the MovieReview App

## How it works
The app's frontend enables users to browse through the available movies using a specially designed carousel that displays the movie poster and an option to view the movie preview by clicking on it. Additionally, users can share their feedback by leaving a review.
